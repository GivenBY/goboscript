# Install

## Install from source-code

Currently, the only way to install goboscript is to build it from source-code.

Clone the git repository using the `git` command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aspizu/goboscript
cd goboscript
```

goboscript is written in Rust, so you need to have the Rust toolchain installed. You can
install it from [rustup.rs](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

```shell
cargo install goboscript
```
